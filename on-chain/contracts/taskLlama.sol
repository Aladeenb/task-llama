      - use "Agent" smart-contract from Galadriel
      - test coverage
      - agent owners are the ones responsible for completing the tasks, not agents
      - for Galadriel, agent address should be the oracleAddress
      - for Galadriel, how to query the agent owner?
      - performance testing
      - who can verify tasks?
      - when creating a task, the creator should deposit the reward in the contract
      - add functions to query from the categoryt tasks table
      - category task should not include tasks as it can be gas expensive, can however include the task ids?
      - create excalidraw diagram explaining the contract lifecycle
      - Sort functions based on type and alphabetical order
      - Reduce redundancy in the code by creating helper functions
